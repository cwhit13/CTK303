      <p> Lyrics </p>
      <p> Now, who's hot, who not? <br>
Tell me who rock, who sell out in the stores? <br>
Whose jewels got rocks? <br>
Who's mostly Dolce down to the tube sock? <br>
The same old pimp, Mase <br>
You know ain't nothing change but my limp<br>
Can't stop till I see my name on a blimp<br>
Guarantee a million sales, call it level up<br>
You don't believe in Harlem World, nigga, double up<br>
We don't play around, it's a bet, lay it down<br>
Niggas didn't know me '91, bet they know me now<br>
I'm the young Harlem nigga with the Goldie sound<br>
Can't no Ph.D. niggas hold me down<br>
Cudda schooled me to the game, now I know my duty<br>
Stay humble, stay low, blow like Hootie<br>
True pimp niggas spend no dough on the booty<br>
And then you yell, "there go Mase!" there go your cutie</p>

<p>I don't know what they want from me<br>
It's like the more money we come across<br>
The more problems we see </p>

<p>I don't know what they want from me<br>
It's like the more money we come across<br>
The more problems we see </p>

<p>I'm the D to the A to the D-D-Y <br>
Know you'd rather see me die than to see me fly<br>
I call all the shots<br>
Rip all the spots, rock all the rocks, cop all the drops<br>
I know you thinking now when all the balling stops<br>
Nigga never home, gotta call me on the yacht<br>
10 years from now we'll still be on top<br>
Yo, I thought I told you that we won't stop<br>
Now what you gon' do with a crew that got money much longer than yours,<br>
And a team much stronger than yours?<br>
Violate me, this'll be your day, we don't play<br>
Mess around, be D.O.A. be on your way<br>
'Cause it ain't enough time here <br>
Ain't enough lime here for you to shine here<br>
Deal with many women but treat dimes fair<br>
And I'm bigger than the city lights down in Times Square</p>

<p>I don't know what they want from me <br>
It's like the more money we come across<br>
The more problems we see</p>

<p>I don't know what they want from me <br>
It's like the more money we come across<br>
The more problems we see</p>

<p> B-I-G P-O-P-P-A, no info for the DEA<br>
Federal agents mad 'cause I'm flagrant<br>
Tap my cell and the phone in the basement<br>
My team supreme, stay clean<br>
Triple beam lyrical dream, I be that<br>
Cat you see at all events bent<br>
Gats in holsters, girls on shoulders<br>
Playboy, I told ya, mere mics to me<br>
Bruise too much, I lose too much<br>
Step on stage, the girls boo too much<br>
I guess it's 'cause you run with lame dudes too much<br>
Me lose my touch? Never that!<br>
If I did, ain't no problem to get the gat<br>
Where the true players at? Throw your Rollies in the sky<br>
Wave 'em side to side and keep your hands high<br>
While I give your girl the eye, player please<br>
Lyrically, niggas see B.I.G be flossing<br>
Jig on the cover of Fortune, 5 double O<br>
Here's my phone number, your man ain't got to know<br>
I got the dough, got the flow down pizat<br>
Platinum plus like thizat<br>
Dangerous on trizacks leave your ass flizat</p>

<p> I don't know what they want from me<br>
It's like the more money we come across<br>
The more problems we see </p>

<p> I don't know what they want from me<br>
It's like the more money we come across<br>
The more problems we see </p>

<p>What's goin' on? What's goin' on? (Somebody tell me) What's goin' on? </p>

<p> I don't know what they want from me<br>
It's like the more money we come across<br>
The more problems we see </p>

<p> I don't know what they want from me<br>
It's like the more money we come across<br>
The more problems we see </p>

<p> I don't know what they want from me<br>
It's like the more money we come across </p>
<br>
