<h4> Safe to Travel </h4>
<p> Bali is a safe place to visit, but be sure not to abandon your common sense. Travel in groups and take the necessary precautions to avoid danger. <br> <br>

Macaque monkeys are commonplace around Bali, but don't be fooled by their cute appearance as they will not scruple from stealing shiny objects and food from unsuspecting tourists. Many a tourist have lost glasses, jewelry, and other belongings to these shifty beasts. Most close encounters with macaques happen around Pura Luhur Uluwatu and the Ubud Monkey Forest in Central Bali. You would also be wise not to smile at them as they interpret bared teeth as a sign of aggression. <br> <br>

The beaches on the southwest part of Bali are known to have dangerous rip tides and undertows. Dangerous beaches are marked by red flags. Do not attempt to swim at red-flagged beaches.<br><br>

Ask your hotel about tsunami evacuation procedures; otherwise, find accommodations at least 150 feet above sea level and two miles inland. <br> <br>
Despite the draconian anti-drug laws, tourists often get stealthy drug offers while walking on the streets, with disguised drug dealers slyly whispering offers of cheap marijuana or mushrooms to likely-looking travelers. If this happens to you, walk away. You're likely to find yourself entrapped in a drug sting. <br><br>

Apply high-SPF sunscreen to forestall the agony of UV-burned skin; SPF (sun protection factor) of no lower than 40 ought to be adequate for a Bali vacation. <br><br>

There are no traffic rules in Bali, only suggestions. Thus, crosswalks (when you can find them) don't get much respect, nor do the pedestrians treading on them.</p>
