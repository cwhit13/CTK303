  <p> Regenerative design is a process-oriented whole systems approach to design. <br>
  The term "regenerative" describes processes that restore, renew or revitalize their own sources of energy and materials.<br>
    Regenerative design uses whole systems thinking to create resilient and equitable systems that integrate the needs of society with the integrity of nature.<br>
Designers use systems thinking, applied permaculture design principles, and community development processes to design human and ecological systems.<br>
The development of regenerative design has been influenced by approaches found in the biomimicry, biophilic design, ecological economics, circular economics.<br>
As well as social movements such as permaculture, transition and the new economy.<br>
