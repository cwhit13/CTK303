<h2>Importance and implications </h2>
<p>It is said that the majority of buildings estimated to exist in the year 2050 have already been built.[27] Additionally, current buildings account for roughly 40 percent of the total energy consumption within the United States. This means that in order to meet climate change goals - such as the Paris Agreement on Climate Change - and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, existing buildings need to be updated to reflect sustainable and regenerative design strategies. </p>

<h2>Strategies</h2>
<p>Craft et al. attempted to create a regenerative design model that could be applied to retrofitting existing buildings. This model was prompted by the large number of currently existing buildings projected to be present in 2050. The model presented in this article for building retrofits follows a ‘Levels of Work’ framework consisting of four levels that are said to be pertinent in increasing the “vitality, viability and capacity for evolution” which require a deep understanding of place and how the building interacts with the natural systems. These four levels are classified as either proactive or reactive and include regenerate, improve, maintain and operate.</p>

<h2>Case Study</h2>
<p>University of New South Wales
Craft et al. present a case study in which the chemical science building at the University of New South Wales was retrofitted to incorporate these regenerative design principles.
The strategy uses biophilia to improve occupants health and wellbeing by strengthening their connection to nature.
The facade acts as a “vertical ecosystem” by providing habitats for indigenous wildlife to increase biodiversity.
This included the addition of balconies to increase the connection between humans and nature.</p>
